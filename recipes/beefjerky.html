<h2>Description</h2>
    <p>A homemade beef jerky marinade made with soy sauce, liquid smoke, brown sugar, and spices makes the most flavorful beef jerky ever!</p>
    <p>I have been making jerky for years and I concocted this recipe by trial and error. Everyone says it is the best jerky they've ever had! </p>
    <p>I hope you enjoy this jerky as much as my family and I do. Store in an airtight container or resealable bags.</p>

<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>

    <li>1/4 cup low-sodium soy sauce</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons Worcestershire sauce</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons liquid smoke</li>  
    <li>2 tablespoons brown sugar</li> 
    <li>2 teaspoons salt</li> 
    <li>1 teaspoon ground black pepper</li> 
    <li>1 teaspoon meat tenderizer</li> 
    <li>1 teaspoon garlic powder</li> 
    <li>1 teaspoon onion powder/li>
    <li>1 teaspoon ground paprika</li>
    <li>2 pounds beef round steak, cut into thin strips</li>

</ul>

<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
    <li>Prepare the marinade: Combine soy sauce, Worcestershire sauce, liquid smoke, brown sugar, salt, pepper, meat tenderizer, garlic powder, onion powder, and paprika in a glass bowl.</li>
    <li>Place beef strips in a 9x13-inch glass baking dish. Pour marinade over top; toss until evenly coated. Cover and marinate in the refrigerator for 8 hours or overnight.</li>
    <li>Remove beef strips from the bowl and place between two pieces of plastic wrap; pound to 1/8-inch thickness.</li>
    <li>Arrange pounded beef strips in a single layer on the trays of a dehydrator. Dry at the dehydrator's highest setting until jerky is done to your liking, at least 4 hours.</li>
    <li>Enjoy!</li>
</ol>
